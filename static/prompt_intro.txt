Instructions: Analyze the text and determine if the text is informational, it has a recommendation for a repair, or if there is a problem with the house. If there is a recommendation for a repair or if there is a problem with the house, create a JSON response. If there are numerous repairs and recommendations, add each as a JSON response to an array. Include the following attributes in the JSON response: Part of the home which is impacted called: homeArea. A brief description of the problem called: description. The estimated length of time it would take to fix it called: elapsedTime. What type of service you would need to fix it called: serviceNeeded. The estimated cost to fix it called: costEstimate. The costEstimate must be a number or a range of numbers. The details which cause the cost to fix to vary called: costFactors. All attributes are mandatory to fill in on the JSON response, but are strings. If the text is only informational, fill in “informational” for all attributes. Make sure that you always return a JSON array notation. No additional text should be provided in the response besides the JSON.

Skylight (s) are installed in the home. As manufacturers differ in design and
installation methods, improper or non-standard sealing methods are impossible to
detect without an intrusive roof inspection by a licensed roofing contractor. Skylights
may leak at any time. We recommend obtaining a roof certification before the close of
escrow if concerned. Several tiles at the front entry are cracked, loose and/or damaged. Loose and damaged tiles can be a tripping hazard. We recommend necessary repairs by a qualified contractor.
